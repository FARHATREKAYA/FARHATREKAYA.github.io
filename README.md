# Farhat Rekaya - Portfolio

A modern, responsive, and premium personal portfolio website showcasing expertise in FinTech systems, DevOps, and high-availability infrastructure.

## Features

- **Modern UI/UX**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a sleek, responsive design.
- **Dark Mode**: Full dark mode support with a user toggle that remembers preferences.
- **Interactive Sections**: Smooth scrolling, scroll-reveal animations, and high-quality hover effects.
- **Responsive**: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewing.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Font Awesome (Icons)
- Google Fonts (Inter, Fira Code)

## Customization

- **Styling**: All main styles use Tailwind utility classes within `index.html`. 
- **Scripts**: Interactive functionality like smooth scroll, dark mode toggle, and mobile menu are handled in `js/scripts.js`.
- **Assets**: Images and downloadable files (like the CV) are stored in the `assets/` directory.

## Running Locally

Because the project is purely static (HTML/CSS/JS), you can run it simply by opening `index.html` in your web browser. 
Alternatively, use a local server like Live Server (VS Code extension) or Python's HTTP server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
